        <div class="tab-page" id="about">Crocus Cafe is a community cafe in Lenton, Nottingham, that was established in 2004 making it the oldest in the city. The cafe serves entirely vegetarian food that is mostly vegan, and particularly caters to students and homeless people. Suspended meals for the latter group may be purchased. The cafe also houses a small shop, with vegetarian groceries and toiletries stocked, as well as a select range of nature-themed art. The cafe is managed by Real Lives - a charity that provides support to vulnerable people in the community. Come and enjoy our wholesome food at not-for-profit prices, in the cosy and cheerful interior of the cafe. Outdoor seating is also available.</div>
